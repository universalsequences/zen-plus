# Bytecode Lisp Interpreter Changelog

## [Initial Implementation] - 2024-02-25

### Added
- Basic bytecode VM architecture with a stack-based execution model
- Compiler to transform AST to bytecode instructions
- OpCode definitions for all VM operations
- Pattern matching support in the VM
- Test suite for verifying bytecode interpreter behavior against tree-walking interpreter
- Benchmark suite for measuring performance improvements
- Documentation of the bytecode architecture and implementation approach

### Core Components Implemented
- **opcodes.ts**: Defines all VM instructions and bytecode data structures
- **vm.ts**: Virtual machine that executes bytecode instructions
- **compiler.ts**: Transforms Lisp AST to VM bytecode
- **index.ts**: Main entry point with API compatible with the original interpreter

### Status
- Basic structure is in place, but implementation is not yet production ready
- Some operators are working (e.g., addition), but most need fixes 
- Function calling, pattern matching, and complex operations still need work
- Testing framework is established, but tests are failing due to implementation gaps

## Roadmap and Priorities

### 1. Fix Core Operators (High Priority)
- [x] Fix addition (+) operator
- [ ] Fix multiplication (*) operator implementation
- [ ] Fix division (/) operator implementation
- [ ] Fix subtraction (-) operator implementation
- [ ] Fix list creation (list) operator
- [ ] Fix comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- [ ] Fix boolean operators (and, or, not)

### 2. Fix Control Flow (High Priority)
- [ ] Fix if expression implementation
- [ ] Fix let expressions for variable binding
- [ ] Fix set operation for variable assignment
- [ ] Implement proper environment scoping

### 3. Fix Function Support (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Fix defun implementation for function definition
- [ ] Fix lambda implementation for anonymous functions
- [ ] Support function application with proper argument handling
- [ ] Add pattern matching for function dispatch
- [ ] Fix function closures and scope handling

### 4. Fix Data Structure Support (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Fix list operations (car, cdr, cons)
- [ ] Fix object literal support and spread operator
- [ ] Support property access (get)
- [ ] Add proper mapping and filtering operations

### 5. Optimize and Test (Medium-High Priority)
- [ ] Add thorough test coverage for all operators
- [ ] Benchmark to verify performance improvements
- [ ] Optimize memory usage with ListPool integration
- [ ] Fix error reporting with source code locations

### 6. Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- [ ] Add tail call optimization for recursive functions
- [ ] Implement JIT compilation for hot functions
- [ ] Add debugging support with source maps
- [ ] Optimize pattern matching dispatch

## Expected Performance Gains
- **Recursive Functions**: 10-20x speedup expected
- **Complex Expressions**: 5-10x speedup expected
- **Pattern Matching**: 3-5x speedup expected
- **Memory Usage**: 30-50% reduction

## Development Notes
- The bytecode interpreter is designed as a drop-in replacement for the existing tree-walking interpreter
- All existing code should work without modifications when the implementation is complete
- Effort is prioritized based on core functionality first, then optimizing performance

## Roadmap Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Core Operations)**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 2 (Control Flow)**: 1-2 days 
- **Phase 3 (Functions)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 4 (Data Structures)**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 5 (Optimization)**: 2-3 days
